# About Project
X-Waves tries to teach a “competing response,” which is the essence of habit reversal therapy. Since the brain can’t do two tics in the exact same instant, physical tics can essentially be neutralized over time.

The user can associate sound patterns to the feeling of comfort felt after doing physical tics, hence creating a reinforcing action that can convert physical tics to mental tics

Using Magic Leap we hope to solve this problem for people with Tourettes Syndrome
